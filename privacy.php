						<p>
							<a name="principles">1. General Principles</a>
							We built Oojo.com to enable you to create and share web based content with your friends and people around you. We understand you may not want everyone to have access to your hosted at Oojo.com; that is why we give you control of your personal content. Our default privacy settings limit the display of your content only to parties you choose to share it with.
							Oojo.com helps you share content with your friends and people around you. You choose what content you make available to the general users of Oojo.com, and you have the ability to control the users with whom you share the content you form, through the settings made during the process of publishing such content.
							Oojo.com is based on the accumulation of user provided and/or formed content and there is an increasing amount of content being made available for Oojo.com users. Oojo.com sees it as its goal to help its users have as much content as possible available for their use while retaining each users privacy.

							<a name="content">3. Collection and Providence of Information and Content</a>
							When you visit Oojo.com you provide us with two types of information: limited personal information and content you knowingly choose to disclose and/or post on the Oojo.com website.
							When you register with Oojo.com, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name and your email address.
							When you enter Oojo.com, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Oojo.com visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID and password to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Oojo.com. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.
							You post User Content (as defined in the Oojo.com Terms of Use) on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your personal content, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and content.

Nevertheless, the required information for your billing will be stored by our payment gateway company which will store your billing information on their secure payment gateway for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription.

							<a name="sharing">5. Sharing Your Content with Third Parties</a>
							Oojo.com provides, as a main service, the ability of sharing created content with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with privacy settings that restrict other users from viewing and/or accessing your content without your consent. We allow you to choose the content you wish to provide to friends and networks through Oojo.com and the manner in which you choose to share it. 
							We may provide information and/or personal user content to service providers to help us provide the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Oojo.com, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services. In connection with these business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information and/or content for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. 
							We occasionally provide demonstrations of user created content that allow non-users a glimpse into the Oojo.com world. Such content is provided in a form which protects your content from any unauthorized editing and/or changing. 
							We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Oojo.com service or using the Oojo.com name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
							We may offer or provide services jointly with other companies on Oojo.com. You can tell when another company is involved in the providence of such service on Oojo.com, and we may share customer information with such third party in connection with your use of such service.
							Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if you are logged out from Oojo.com, or that pertains to non-Oojo.com users, from those sites in conjunction with the technical operation of our system. In cases where Oojo.com receives information on users that are not logged in, or on non-Oojo.com users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Oojo.com accounts and will discard it. 
							In any case in which the ownership of Oojo.com's business shall change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
							When you use Oojo.com, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone in your network), such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk.
